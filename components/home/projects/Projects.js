          Zoom is a tool used by thousands of people every day that truly helps
          in the coopeartion and interaction between remote teams and
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Utilizing the power of NextJS and Stream io I built the entire project
          to be 100% functional, including functionalities like microphone and
          camera selection by the user, as well as setting up different settings
          for the display and the interface and record their sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the application the user can create a meeting, schedule a
          meeting for a date and time in the future and also invite people to
          join their meeting through a link. Moreover, they can view their
          recorded sessions whenever they want through a dedicated Recordings
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for the user to use the service they have to authenticate
          through Clerk Authentication either by creating their own
          username/password or via their Gmail, Github or Linkedin account
        </p>
        <p>
          For the UI I used Tailwind CSS and Shadcn to make it pixel perfect,
          offering the best experience for the user.
